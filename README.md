### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ˜„ I'm baicai, a very delicious vegetable.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€˜m passionate about the integration of finance, technology and education, and I have made some attempts, most of which have failed. Some were based on personal interests, and more were involved in teams.
- ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m currently learning and applying AI, hoping to use AI as a tool for work assistance. For example, I have built some simple backtesting models through algorithms to evaluate the rationality of my own trend analysis.
- ðŸ”­ I am not good at technical development. I can only write simple Python and Node.js programs. I often feel that my technical skills are not enough. Therefore, I am looking forward to meeting some friends who are good at technology. Of course, it would be better if you are also interested in finance or education.
